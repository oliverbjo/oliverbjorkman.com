                                    <p>Our flight was at 8 in the night, so we had the whole day to pack the mountains of gifts for our relatives over in Beijing. The gifts ranged from chocolate to even Turmeric. The Turmeric caused some especially interesting problems, because the TSA opened my bag on that metal table with a privacy screen, and saw the Turmeric. However, all was well becuase apart from some weird looks and shuffling around of my bag, the TSA didn't give me a hard time. We first flew to Las Vegas, then were transfered onto an airplane to China. When we got there, as it was December, the temperature was horrendously freezing, but with no snow, which was good. We got there in the early morning, so by the time we had gotten through security and immigration, the sun had risen. After stopping at my Grandma's (or wài pó 外婆) apartment for a quick meal, all five of us (me, my brother, mother, father, and grandma), along with my uncle and aunt took the drive to the hotel. My grandma would be staying with us for the duration of the trip. We stayed in the hotel for the rest of the day, looking at what we would do in the next days. We went out to eat dinner in one of the local restaurants, then went back to the hotel to sleep.

                                    <p>We woke up pretty early in the day, about 8, and went to eat breakfast in the hotel. It was a luxurious spread of things from Nutella to noodles, truly a east-west blend. We then went to the Temple of Heaven, otherwise known as Tian Tan. It was truly a majestic temple, and there were many interesting things to see there, like the echo wall, a circular wall that you could speak towards that projected your voice around the whole circle. We then took one of my mother's relatives to eat at a place with classic Beijing food, and it was delicious. We then went back to the hotel, where we went swimming, followed by dinner in one of the restaurants near the hotel.</p>

                                    <p>The next day, we went to the Silk Street market, a famous fake market that happened to be quite close to our hotel, so we took the subway. The Beijing subway system made the New York or any other United States subway system look comparable to hippos running in circles, while they had smooth, clean, and well optimized subways. The silk street market was a huge, multi-floor mall that had things like "Supreme" and "Off-White", some of which were quite convincing fakes, while others were simply hideous. The culture of the place was to bargain with the shop tenders, becuase they would start at a price of, lets say, 2000 RMB, which basically meant that you could get it for around 200. In the night, we went to a very nice mall that had really nice lights on the trees and storefronts. We then headed back the hotel, where we hit the pillow.</p>
